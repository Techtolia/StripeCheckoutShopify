# Expand Your Shopify Store's Reach with EasyPie Checkout and Stripe

In today’s digital landscape, e-commerce businesses are constantly looking for ways to expand their reach, enhance customer experience, and improve conversion rates. One of the most effective ways to do this is by offering a diverse range of payment options that accommodate customers from all over the world. Shopify store owners, especially those in Poland, Europe, and beyond, can significantly benefit from providing localized payment methods, multi-currency support, and fast, secure checkout experiences. That’s where Stripe and the EasyPie Checkout for Shopify come into play.

## Why Payment Methods Matter for Your Shopify Store

Payment methods are a critical factor that influences whether a potential customer completes a purchase or abandons their cart. A streamlined, secure, and convenient payment process enhances the user experience, reduces cart abandonment, and builds trust with customers. In Poland, in particular, there are specific payment methods like Przelewy24 and BLIK that are commonly used by locals and can help Shopify merchants increase their sales by offering familiar and popular payment options.

With Stripe, EasyPie Checkout, and support for these payment methods, Shopify store owners can open their doors to both local Polish shoppers and international customers, unlocking global potential. Let's dive into the details of how integrating these solutions can take your business to the next level.

## Stripe + EasyPie Checkout: The Perfect Solution for Shopify Stores

When it comes to handling payments on Shopify, Stripe has emerged as one of the most trusted payment processors globally. It’s known for its secure, reliable, and developer-friendly platform that makes it easy for merchants to accept a wide variety of payment methods. EasyPie Checkout for Shopify enhances this experience by providing a seamless, all-in-one payment integration that simplifies the process for both merchants and customers.

### 1. No Additional Fees from Shopify
For Shopify store owners, one of the most significant concerns when integrating third-party payment gateways is the potential for hidden fees. Shopify's native payment gateway, Shopify Payments, is already built into the platform, but third-party gateways often come with extra fees that can eat into your profit margins. This is where EasyPie Checkout shines.

EasyPie Checkout allows you to integrate Stripe without incurring additional fees from Shopify. The payment processing fees that you see on Stripe’s pricing page are all-inclusive, so there are no surprises. This transparency in pricing gives merchants peace of mind, knowing exactly what their payment processing costs will be.

### 2. Multi-Currency Support: Cater to International Customers
As the e-commerce world grows, offering multi-currency support is becoming increasingly essential. Shopify merchants who want to expand beyond local markets need to provide a localized shopping experience for international customers. EasyPie Checkout makes this possible with Stripe’s support for over 135 currencies, including popular currencies like USD, EUR, GBP, and more.

With multi-currency support, you can display product prices in the customer’s local currency and offer them a familiar checkout experience. Stripe also offers multi-currency settlement, meaning you can receive payouts in your preferred currency while still managing transactions across different currencies. This eliminates the need for complex currency conversions or accounting challenges and makes global expansion much more manageable for Shopify merchants.

### 3. Localized Payment Methods for Poland: Przelewy24 and BLIK
For Polish Shopify store owners, supporting popular local payment methods can significantly boost sales. In Poland, Przelewy24 and BLIK are two of the most widely used payment options for online shopping. EasyPie Checkout makes it simple to integrate these payment methods into your Shopify store, allowing Polish customers to complete their purchases easily and securely.

#### Przelewy24: A Popular Payment Aggregator in Poland
Przelewy24 is a leading Polish payment method aggregator that allows customers to complete online transactions via bank transfers and other popular methods. In Poland, bank transfers account for approximately 30% of all online payments, making Przelewy24 an essential payment option for local merchants.

With Przelewy24, customers can make payments through over 165 Polish banks, which ensures that a broad segment of the population can pay easily. By integrating Przelewy24 into your Shopify store using EasyPie Checkout, you make it easier for Polish customers to complete purchases using their preferred payment method.

#### BLIK: Fast and Secure Mobile Payments in Poland
Another highly popular payment method in Poland is BLIK. This mobile payment system allows users to make secure payments using their smartphones. To pay with BLIK, customers request a six-digit code from their banking app and enter it into the payment collection form when making a purchase online.

The simplicity and security of BLIK have made it a preferred option for Polish shoppers, especially those who value a fast and easy payment process. Integrating BLIK into your Shopify store with EasyPie Checkout ensures that you cater to this large and growing segment of the market.

### 4. Offer Popular Payment Methods with a Single Integration
EasyPie Checkout allows Shopify merchants to accept a wide variety of popular payment methods with just one integration. By providing multiple payment options, you can appeal to a broader audience, reduce cart abandonment, and increase your conversion rates. Some of the key payment methods supported by EasyPie Checkout and Stripe include:

#### Credit and Debit Cards
Credit and debit cards are among the most popular online payment methods globally. By accepting both domestic and international card payments, you open your store to a wide range of customers. With Stripe, you can easily process payments made using credit and debit cards from major issuers like Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover.

#### Digital Wallets
In today’s mobile-first world, digital wallets like Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal, Revolut Pay, and MobilePay are becoming more popular. By integrating these wallets into your Shopify store, you can speed up the checkout process by auto-filling payment details, making the entire transaction faster and more convenient for customers.

#### Bank-Based Payment Methods
Bank transfers and direct payments are common in many European countries. By accepting bank-based payment methods like SEPA Direct Debit, BLIK, Przelewy24, Bancontact, Sofort, and Swish, you can offer customers a more convenient payment option that may reduce transaction costs compared to traditional credit card payments.

#### Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) Options
Consumers today want flexibility in how they pay. By offering Buy Now, Pay Later options like Klarna, you give your customers the opportunity to pay for larger purchases in installments. This flexibility can increase the likelihood of a purchase, particularly for higher-value items.

#### Cash-Based Vouchers
In some regions, especially in Southern Europe, customers prefer to pay for online purchases using cash-based vouchers. Multibanco is one such example, which allows customers to pay bills and make online purchases in-store with cash. Offering cash-based vouchers as a payment option ensures that you don't miss out on customers who don’t use digital payment methods.

### 5. Improve Conversion Rates with a Seamless Checkout Experience
The checkout process is one of the most critical aspects of any online store. A slow, complicated, or insecure checkout experience can lead to abandoned carts and lost sales. EasyPie Checkout optimizes the checkout process by providing an intuitive, fast, and secure payment gateway. Customers can complete their purchases quickly and confidently, resulting in higher conversion rates and more sales.
