![IntroNew4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c16a7e3-d81a-405b-a588-b50aea6a438d)

As eCommerce continues to expand globally, it is essential for merchants to offer a wide variety of payment options to meet the diverse preferences of their customers. Shopify store owners, particularly those in the Netherlands, across the European Union (EU), and beyond, need a seamless solution to accept different payment methods and currencies. This not only enhances the customer experience but also drives conversions and helps businesses expand their market reach. By integrating Stripe with EasyPie Checkout on Shopify, merchants can accept a broad spectrum of payment options, including iDEAL and SEPA Direct Debit, and even set up subscriptions effortlessly.

## Accept Popular Payment Methods with a Single Integration

Stripe and EasyPie Checkout make it easier than ever for Shopify merchants to integrate a wide variety of payment methods from one unified platform. This solution allows you to cater to local and international customers with minimal setup, and ensures a smooth checkout experience.

### 1. Credit and Debit Cards
Credit and debit cards remain one of the most widely used payment methods worldwide. With Stripe's integration, Shopify merchants can easily accept major card brands like Visa, MasterCard, and American Express, ensuring a secure and familiar payment option for their customers.

### 2. Digital Wallets
Digital wallets are growing in popularity for their convenience and security. By integrating Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal, Alipay, Revolut Pay, and WeChat Pay, Shopify merchants can provide customers with multiple ways to pay using their smartphones, ensuring faster, frictionless transactions.

### 3. Bank-Based Payment Methods
In the EU, particularly in the Netherlands, bank-based payments are the preferred choice. With Stripe and EasyPie Checkout, merchants can accept a range of popular bank-based payment methods such as iDEAL, SEPA Direct Debit, Bancontact, BLIK, Sofort, EPS, and Przelewy24. These methods are particularly advantageous for businesses targeting European customers because they offer lower processing fees and provide a secure and familiar payment experience.

In particular, iDEAL is the most popular online payment method in the Netherlands, representing about 70% of all online transactions. It allows customers to make payments directly from their bank accounts with no need for credit cards, offering a seamless and secure experience.

### 4. Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)
Services like Klarna allow customers to split payments or pay later, which has become particularly appealing for larger purchases. By offering BNPL options, Shopify merchants can boost their conversion rates by providing flexible payment options that encourage purchases, especially among price-sensitive customers.

### 5. Cash-Based Vouchers
Multibanco is an example of a payment method that lets customers pay for online purchases with cash through in-store vouchers. This solution is popular in regions like Portugal, helping merchants reach a wider audience who prefer paying with cash.

## Set Up Subscriptions with iDEAL and SEPA Direct Debit

With Stripe’s powerful integration, Shopify merchants can not only accept single payments but also easily set up recurring billing and subscription payments. Subscriptions are becoming a crucial feature for businesses offering products or services on an ongoing basis, such as software subscriptions, membership programs, and subscription box services.

To enhance subscription offerings, Stripe supports iDEAL for the first payment and SEPA Direct Debit for recurring payments. Here’s how it works:

- **iDEAL for the First Payment**: iDEAL is a single-use payment method that requires customers to authenticate each payment. When a customer subscribes to your service, the first payment will be processed via iDEAL, and the customer will authenticate the transaction using their online banking credentials.
- **SEPA Direct Debit for Recurring Payments**: After the initial payment is authenticated via iDEAL, Stripe saves the customer's IBAN (International Bank Account Number) in the system. This enables you to set up SEPA Direct Debit as the preferred method for recurring payments. This means that subsequent payments will be processed through SEPA Direct Debit, allowing businesses to collect payments automatically on a regular schedule without requiring customer intervention.

With this integration, you can set up recurring subscriptions in your Shopify store and securely manage payments without needing to request customer details repeatedly. This streamlined process enhances the customer experience and reduces friction in subscription-based businesses.

### Key Benefits of Setting Up Subscriptions with iDEAL and SEPA Direct Debit:
- **Convenient for Customers**: After the initial payment, customers don’t need to re-enter their banking details for future payments, offering a smooth subscription experience.
- **Secure and Reliable**: Both iDEAL and SEPA Direct Debit are highly secure methods for handling payments directly from customers’ bank accounts.
- **Lower Transaction Costs**: Bank-based payment methods like SEPA Direct Debit often carry lower fees compared to credit card payments, making it a cost-effective choice for recurring billing.

## No Additional Fees with EasyPie Checkout

A significant concern for Shopify merchants using third-party payment gateways is the risk of hidden or additional fees that can eat into profits. This is especially true when dealing with international payments and multiple currencies. However, with EasyPie Checkout, merchants enjoy no additional fees beyond Stripe’s standard payment processing charges. This means Shopify store owners can keep more of their profits, without worrying about surprise fees when dealing with international transactions.

For merchants in the Netherlands and across the EU, this can be a crucial advantage, as international payments often come with additional fees. EasyPie’s transparent pricing structure allows you to focus on growing your business while minimizing unexpected costs.

## The Growing Popularity of Digital Payments in the Netherlands

The Netherlands has long been at the forefront of digital payment adoption, and this trend continues to accelerate. A 2023 report from the Dutch Central Bank (DNB) shows that while 81% of people in the Netherlands still carry cash, 59% expect they will use cash less frequently or not at all in the next five years.

The country’s financial sector is highly advanced, and contactless payments are particularly popular. In 2023, 91% of all card payments were contactless, showing how prevalent this payment method has become. Among online transactions, iDEAL remains the dominant payment method, accounting for 70% of all online payments in the Netherlands as of 2022.

### Popular Payment Methods in the Netherlands:
#### B2C (Business to Consumer) Payment Methods:
- Contactless credit and debit cards
- Bank-based real-time payments like iDEAL
- Mobile payment apps such as Apple Pay and Google Pay
- Buy Now, Pay Later services (e.g., Klarna)
#### B2B (Business to Business) Payment Methods:
- Credit cards
- Direct debits (e.g., SEPA Direct Debit)
- Bank transfers
- Buy Now, Pay Later services

These preferences make it clear that local payment options, such as iDEAL and SEPA Direct Debit, are essential for businesses targeting Dutch customers and the broader EU market. Shopify merchants can ensure they meet these needs by using EasyPie Checkout to integrate these payment methods effortlessly.
