Expanding your e-commerce business into international markets presents both opportunities and challenges. Whether you’re targeting customers in the United States, Australia, or other countries around the world, understanding the local payment preferences and providing a seamless, secure checkout experience is essential for driving sales and fostering customer loyalty. In this article, we’ll explore how Shopify merchants can boost their sales by offering a variety of popular payment methods, local and international currencies, and how EasyPie Checkout, powered by Stripe, makes this integration simple and cost-effective.

## Expanding into the US Market

The United States, as the world’s largest economy, presents a massive opportunity for businesses looking to expand their reach. In 2022 alone, e-commerce revenue in the US totaled a staggering **$905 billion USD**, and this figure is projected to continue growing. However, businesses hoping to tap into the US market face several challenges, including the diversity of payment options, regulatory requirements, and concerns around security and compliance. 

Despite these challenges, the potential for growth is enormous. Understanding the payment preferences of American consumers and adapting to their expectations is key to unlocking this lucrative market. By integrating a variety of payment methods, such as credit and debit cards, digital wallets, bank transfers, and even “Buy Now, Pay Later” (BNPL) options, Shopify merchants can offer a competitive and tailored payment experience that meets the diverse needs of US shoppers.

## The Australian Payments Landscape

Australia’s e-commerce market is also a significant opportunity for Shopify store owners. According to Mordor Intelligence, the Australian payments market is projected to grow from **$920 billion AUD in 2024** to **$1.97 trillion AUD by 2029**. As more Australians shop online, providing them with an easy and secure payment experience is vital for businesses looking to tap into this expanding market.

In Australia, payment preferences are quite diverse. While credit and debit cards are still the dominant payment method, Australians are increasingly using digital wallets such as **Apple Pay** and **Google Pay**. Additionally, **"Buy Now, Pay Later"** services like **Afterpay** have seen explosive growth in recent years, particularly among younger shoppers. As such, understanding how to accept these payment methods is crucial for businesses aiming to succeed in the Australian market.

## The Power of Stripe and EasyPie Checkout for Shopify

To help Shopify merchants expand into the US, Australia, and beyond, integrating Stripe with EasyPie Checkout offers a seamless, powerful solution for accepting a wide variety of payment methods and managing international payments. Let’s explore how these tools can help you boost your Shopify sales.

### 1. No Additional Fees from Shopify

When using third-party payment gateways, Shopify store owners often worry about hidden fees that can eat into their profit margins. This is especially true when it comes to international payments, which can come with added processing fees. Many payment processors impose extra charges for handling payments, especially when dealing with different currencies. With **EasyPie Checkout**, however, Shopify merchants can enjoy **no additional fees** beyond the standard payment processing fees outlined on Stripe’s pricing page.

This transparency in pricing is incredibly beneficial for merchants who want to have a clear understanding of the costs involved in accepting payments. By eliminating hidden fees, EasyPie Checkout provides merchants with more control over their costs, helping them make better decisions when it comes to pricing and managing their revenue.

### 2. Multi-Currency Support for Global Expansion

As e-commerce continues to grow, it’s essential for Shopify merchants to cater to international customers. One of the biggest barriers to expanding into global markets is the complexity of handling multiple currencies. EasyPie Checkout, powered by Stripe, solves this problem by supporting **over 135 currencies**, including the **USD, AUD, EUR, GBP**, and many more. This multi-currency support allows merchants to provide a **localized shopping experience** for customers from different regions, making them feel more comfortable when making a purchase.

For Shopify store owners, this means that you can display product prices in the local currency of the customer and allow them to complete their purchase in the currency they’re most familiar with. Furthermore, Stripe offers **multi-currency settlement**, which allows you to receive payouts in your preferred currency while still managing transactions across different currencies. This simplifies the process of handling international sales and eliminates the complexities of currency conversions, enabling you to focus on scaling your business.

### 3. Accept Popular Payment Methods with a Single Integration

Offering a variety of payment methods is essential for increasing conversion rates and attracting a broader customer base. EasyPie Checkout makes it easy for Shopify merchants to accept a wide range of popular payment methods with a single integration. This includes everything from traditional credit and debit card payments to digital wallets, bank transfers, and “Buy Now, Pay Later” options.

Let’s take a look at the key payment methods that EasyPie Checkout supports:

#### Digital Wallets:
Digital wallets like **Apple Pay**, **Google Pay**, **Alipay**, and **WeChat Pay** are becoming increasingly popular for online purchases, especially among mobile-first shoppers.

By integrating BNPL options, you can increase the likelihood of larger purchases and reduce cart abandonment rates.

### 4. Fast and Secure Checkout Experience
